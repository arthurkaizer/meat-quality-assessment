***Purpose of the work***

This dataset was collected in order to develop a meat quality assessment system which is based on deep learning. 
All of the experimental results which are explained in the paper, prove the usability of our dataset and our model can successfully distinguish between the classes with high accuracy.


***Resolution and the Number of the Images***

Images were collected via an IP camera and the resolution of the images are 1280 x 720. There are 1896 images in total, 948 per class.
